## Monthly Mean Temperature in Melbourne (1944-2024)

An interactive D3.js chart visualising 80 years of monthly maximum temperatures in Melbourne.

Inspired by [Peter Cook’s UK temperature visualisation](https://app.peterrcook.com/uktemp/), this project explores long-term climate patterns using open Australian weather data.

### About the Project

This project was sparked by two key questions:

1. **What would this chart look like for my hometown, Melbourne?**  
2. **Could we see patterns of increasing temperature as the climate crisis has worsened in recent years?**

Using data from the [Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)](https://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/), I created an interactive visualisation of Melbourne's monthly maximum temperatures from 1944 to 2024.

### Insights

#### Long-Term Warming Trend
The yearly average temperature line reveals a sustained warming trend, particularly evident from the 1980s onward. Notably, 2023–2024 represents a new peak in the dataset, aligning with global climate records and underscoring the local manifestation of broader environmental changes. What was once an occasional summer high of 26°C is now a recurring feature of Melbourne’s climate.

#### Increasing Frequency of Extreme Months
High-temperature months (25°C and above) have become increasingly common and clustered in recent decades. This pattern suggests that Melbourne is not only warming on average, but also experiencing more frequent extremes, a critical indicator of increasing climate variability and volatility.

#### Persistence of Seasonality with Elevated Baselines
Seasonal cycles remain apparent in the data; however, the overall temperature distribution has shifted upward. The range between cooler and warmer months has narrowed, with both ends of the spectrum now operating from a higher baseline. While seasonal variation persists, it is now characterised by consistently elevated temperatures year-round.

#### Acceleration After 2000  
The most significant increase in average temperatures has occurred since the early 2000s. This sharp rise aligns with international climate projections that anticipate accelerated warming in the 21st century, largely driven by human activity. The Melbourne dataset provides clear local evidence of this global trajectory.

#### Reflection  
What began as a design-inspired question became a powerful data story. Through this project, I confirmed that city-level data can uncover clear global patterns, and that interactive visualisation is a compelling way to turn complex issues into accessible, engaging insights.
